# Infrastructure Automation with Jenkins, Docker, AWS CLI, Kubernetes, and ArgoCD

## Project Description
This project aims to streamline and automate the deployment of infrastructure on the cloud using a combination of powerful DevOps tools. By leveraging Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, AWS CLI for managing resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Kubernetes for container orchestration, and ArgoCD for GitOps workflows, this project empowers teams to rapidly deploy, scale, and manage cloud infrastructure with efficiency and reliability.

## Features


**Continuous Integration:** Automate the build and testing process with Jenkins pipelines.


**Containerization:** Utilize Docker to package applications and dependencies into lightweight containers.


**Cloud Deployment:** Harness the power of AWS CLI to provision and manage cloud resources on AWS.


**Container Orchestration:** Deploy and manage containerized applications at scale with Kubernetes.


**GitOps Workflows:** Implement declarative continuous delivery with ArgoCD, ensuring infrastructure configurations are synchronized with Git repositories.


## Getting Started


To get started with this project, follow these steps:



Clone the repository to your local machine.


Install the necessary dependencies: Jenkins, Docker, AWS CLI, Kubernetes, and ArgoCD.


Configure access to your AWS account and Kubernetes cluster.


Set up Jenkins pipelines for your project.


Define Kubernetes manifests and ArgoCD applications for your infrastructure components.


Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to automate the deployment process.



## Usage


Clone the repository:


```git clone https://github.com/StavrosZacharia/devops-aws.git```


Install dependencies locally:


**Docker**: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


**Jenkins**: [Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/)



## These dependencies need to be installed on both local as well as the docker container created above


**AWS CLI**: [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)


**Kubernetes**: [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)


**ArgoCD**: [Installation Guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/)
